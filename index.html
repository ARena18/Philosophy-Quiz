                <b>A.</b> To possess the ability to think is enough to confirm that I exists; thinking is like consciousness.

                <input type="radio" name="q4" value="descartes">
                <b>A.</b> Maybe they don&apos;t actually exist; I&apos;ve never stepped into their companies or worked for them so I can&apos;t be sure that they are real.

                <input type="radio" name="q4" value="camus">

                <input type="radio" name="q4" value="foucault">
                <b>C.</b> They are evil; they try to make themselves look fun, cool, innocent, and beneficial for my life, but they actually take control of my life entirely, trying to make me buy their things. I am reduced to a slave under them.

                <input type="radio" name="q6" value="descartes">
                <b>A.</b> Denial; How can I be certain that the results of the history test are true? Perhaps my perceptions are tricking me and I am in a dream.
            </label>
            <label>
                <input type="radio" name="q6" value="camus">
                <b>B.</b> Acceptance; It was uncertain whether my efforts would have granted me the results I wanted. Perhaps this was how it would have turned out either way and I should make do with my situation.

                <input type="radio" name="q6" value="foucault">

                <b>B.</b> No matter what life throws at me, good or bad, it is up to me to either view the circumstance in a half full or half empty way; my happiness is determined by me.
            </label>
            <label>
                <input type="radio" name="q7" value="foucault">
                <b>C.</b> True happiness doesn&apos;t exist in life. What we are led to believe happiness is is just ideas we have been taught to think are happy by school (like having a good job or raising a family) and/or by brands and social media (like beating a video game or wearing the current trend&apos;s clothing).

                <input type="radio" name="q8" value="descartes">
                <b>A.</b> I am very curious as to how they designed this drug. What chemicals did they use? Are they going to continue efforts to make this drug using different strategies and/or chemicals?
            </label>
            <label>
                <input type="radio" name="q8" value="camus">
                <b>B.</b> Life is absurd so of course such an ambitious drug failed. With life&apos;s many obstacles and challenges, achieving a successful end result is hard and rare.
            </label>
            <label>
                <input type="radio" name="q8" value="foucault">
                <b>C.</b> Is being short really a bad thing or is it just a concept that the science field as well as social media have developed that has influenced our mindset on height? Someone being short is not a bad thing and therefore this drug is pointless.

                <input type="radio" name="q9" value="descartes">
                <b>A.</b> I understand where it comes from. Some people state things that I cannot understand and that should not be perceived as truth. They challenge my conclusions about myself and my existence.
            </label>
            <label>
                <input type="radio" name="q9" value="camus">
                <b>B.</b> It is another aspect that demonstrates the absurdity of life. People who have built their careers over years and decades can lose it in a matter of days.
            </label>
            <label>
                <input type="radio" name="q9" value="foucault">
                <b>C.</b> It demonstrates the strength of the power exercised by the authoritative body. People who stray from the path determined by authority are brought down and removed from society&apos;s view.

            <h3 class="qText">10. While having a conversation with a classmate, the classmate said something heavily against your morals. You cannot comprehend why they would think as such and got into an argument with that classmate, leaving you very upset. How would you respond?</h3>

                <input type="radio" name="q10" value="descartes">
                <b>A.</b> Avoidant; I am certain that I am thinking and following my morals, and that they exist. Why should I have to interact with a being that goes against my thoughts, and that follows morals that I cannot prove?
            </label>
            <label>
                <input type="radio" name="q10" value="camus">
                <b>B.</b> Cooperative; Life is absurd, and not everything flows the way I imagine it to. As such, conflicts and arguments are a natural part of life. If the time comes to reconcile, it will happen so for now, I should do what I can do for myself.
            </label>
            <label>
                <input type="radio" name="q10" value="foucault">
                <b>C.</b> Conciliatory; Conflicts and arguments are not looked upon fondly by the school or society. Rather, it is advised that people maintain good relationships with others. Therefore, I should find a way to resolve the issue as fast as possible.
